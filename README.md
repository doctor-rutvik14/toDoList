## jQuery Explaination:

### Selecting Elements
- $(".remove"): This jQuery selector selects all elements with the class "remove".
### Event Handling
- .on("click", function() {...}): This attaches a click event handler to all elements with the class "remove". When this element is clicked, the function inside the .on() method is executed.
### Handling Click Events
- function() {...}: This is a function that executes when a click event occurs on an element with the class "remove".
### Removing Parent Elements
- $(this): This refers to the specific element that triggered the click event (i.e., the element with the class "remove" that was clicked).
- .parent(): This selects the immediate parent of the clicked element.
- .remove(): This removes the selected parent element and its contents from the DOM (Document Object Model), effectively deleting it from the webpage.
